## What Minecraft version should I choose?

### Unsure? -> 1.16.1

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
	
You might think you should use the latest version of Minecraft, but there are many reasons that make **1.16.1** the most popular version for speedrunning. Not only is it the fastest version of the game, it also relies way less on RNG to complete a run than newer versions.

Because of this, 1.16.1 gets the most support when it comes to speedrunning specific mods, resources, and guides.

However, other versions of Minecraft are still popular to speedrun. **1.15.2** is popular due to being the last version before The Nether Update, which dramatically changed Minecraft speedruns. This means that the speedrun route for 1.15.2 and below is very different from newer versions of the game.

Of course, if you still want to speedrun the latest versions of the game, go ahead! Just know that it will be very different from what most people play: you will find piglin brutes in bastions; the rates at which you get ender pearls from piglins are much worse; the new world generation makes getting to the nether difficult; the F3 pie chart works differently; and much more.

## My settings keep reverting to defaults!

This is due to the StandardSettings mod, which changes your settings to a preset default every time you load a new world.

To fix this, you can either disable the mod or set it up to revert to the settings you choose.

### Steps

1. In the options menu, click on the Mod Configs button (the book icon)
2. Open the StandardSettings config
3. To disable StandardSettings set 'Use StandardSettings' to 'OFF'  
Otherwise, change the settings in this menu to the ones you would usually use. You can press 'CTRL+F' to search for a setting.

## How to set up SeedQueue (MC 1.16.1/1.15.2 Only)
> Generate many worlds at once on a single-instance using SeedQueue

[Here's a video guide to setup SeedQueue](https://youtu.be/fGu2MYZxh_c). The guide is for MultiMC, but the steps should be similar in most other launchers.  
You don't need to watch the separate set-up video mentioned as the modpack does that bit for you.
